```{r}

```{r}
## read in data and skip the first 4 lines (metadata)
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters.xlsx"), skip=4)

```

```{r}
skimr::skim(lobsters)
```

This skimr:: notation is a reminder to me that skim is from the skimr package. It is a nice convention: itâ€™s a reminder to others (especially you!).

```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarise(count_by_siteyear = n())
```
```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarise(count_by_siteyear = n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm))
```
```{r}
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r}
siteyear_summary
```

```{r}
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()
```

There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report.

```{r}
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

 
```{r}
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) +
  geom_line() 
```

```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~site)
```

```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-col.png"))
```
